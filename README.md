This application's user interface is composed of geometric shapes arranged in a particular order.    This application's user interface has one area containing multiple colored rectangles and another containing a SeekBar (sometimes called a Slider). When the user drags the SeekBar, all non-white / non- grey rectangles gradually change their color.
